<p>Collection of personal information</p>
<p>As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, such as utilizing online or hosted Programs and Services, ilimi may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting a form. It is optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, ilimi may ask that you provide certain personal information (as well as certain non-personal information that may be tied to personal information), such as your first and last name, mailing address (including ZIP code), country of residence, e-mail address, employer, job title and department, and telephone and facsimile numbers. Depending upon the activity you intend to use on some Services and Programs, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity. Similarly, if you wish to delete your information that is mandatory, you will no longer be able to engage in that particular activity.</p>
<p>When you use the Site and the Services, ilimi may also collect certain information about your computer to facilitate, evaluate and verify your use of the Site and the Services. For example, we may log environmental variables, such as browser type, operating system, CPU speed, referring or exit webpages, click patterns, Session ID (a unique identifier assigned to the browser in connection to the Site), and the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer. ilimi also uses such information to measure traffic patterns on the Site and usage of the Programs and Services. We do not match such information with personal information held about you by ilimi unless we have your consent, except as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you decide to send us an electronic mail message (e-mail), the message will usually contain return e-mail address. If you include, personally-identifiable information in your e-mail, because you want us to address specific to your situation. We may use that information in responding to your request, e-mail is not necessarily secure against interception. Please send us only information to help us process your request for the specified service.</p>
<p>On some of our web pages, we offer interactive forms that let you voluntarily consent to submit personal information (such as your e-mail, address, name or organisation). This occurs when you are registering for online counselling, various test, quizzes, seminars, workshops or training sessions offered by ilimi. In those cases, all submitted information is used only for the purposes for which it is intended and is not made available to any third party, other than specifically permitted under this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>By using this Site and the Programs and Services, you agree and acknowledge that personal information collected through the Site or in connection with the Programs and Services may be transferred across national boundaries and stored and processed in India. You also acknowledge that in certain countries or with respect to certain activities, the collection, transfer, storage, and processing of your information may be undertaken by trusted third party vendors or agents of ilimi such as credit card processors, shipping agents, web hosting providers, mail and email service providers, communication services, and web analytic providers, to help facilitate ilimi in providing certain functions. </p>
<p>Another instance where this could occur is in conjunction with framed pages in which the URL for the pages is not visible, and the pages are hosted for ilimi by such third party vendors. The pages may be hosted by a third party vendor, but appear to be in the ilimi page and they are therefore governed by this Privacy Policy. Personal information may be shared with these providers to fulfill the service. Such third parties are bound by contract with ilimi not to use your personal information for their own purposes or provide it to any third parties. We will be sharing any of the personal information provided by you in response to any subpoenas, court orders, or legal process.</p>
<p>Personal Information that users provide about other individuals for referral features on the Site or within Programs and Services is used by ilimi to send an initial communication to the person whose details you have provided, and is not retained in ilimi's systems. If you are invited by someone else to participate in shared editing or viewing of documents, photos, websites or other content, you will typically be required to contact the person who invited you to update, correct or delete the personal information they provided about you. </p>
<p>In general, even though we may delete an account you hold with us in these types of shared editing or viewing areas, we may continue to retain information regarding your past actions with respect to content reviews or sharing initiated by others.</p>
<p>We may also ask you to provide information of others such as when reporting suspected piracy. In this instance, we will ask for the person's or company's name and contact information so that we may investigate. Personal information supplied in these instances will only be used for the purpose being submitted.</p>
<p>ilimi also hires other companies to place our banner ads on other websites. Such companies perform tracking and reporting activities on ads served and user reaction ("third-party advertisement servers"). They do not collect any information other than IP addresses and behaviours associated with those IP addresses on our behalf, and we do not give any personal information to them. Third-party advertisement servers are subject to their own privacy policies. ilimi may also allow other companies to display advertisements on certain pages of the Site or within the Programs and Services. If you click on these advertisements these companies may place a persistent cookie on your computer which may allow them to display further advertisements to you. It is our policy to require these companies to provide accessible methods for you to disable these cookies.</p>
