Ilimi's semantic search engines assemble thousands of connected concepts, to be explored explore while learning, along with tens of thousands of relevant content videos, exercises and documents. Almost any learner need can be addressed with this content. As a learner goes through a course, Ilimi's analytical engines automatically recommend content based on the learner's needs. Much like Amazon's recommendations!</p>

However practitioner do not have time to teach every student or to create complete courses. Ilimi, with its semantic APIs makes it easy for practitioners to share their expertise. Practitioners focus on recording their course videos, the Ilimi engines automatically enhance these videos with exercises and supplemental content to make them complete from any learner's perspective. </p>

                          <p class="explr-content">In each course, learners are assigned to expert tutors who provide individual attention. Ilimi uses analytics and semantic technologies to scale tutoring ratios to around 1:500 instead of 1:25. Analytics helps identify the precise intervention a learner needs. The first line of intervention is to recommend content or exercises from Ilimi's massive repository. Further, groups of learners with the same needs are invited to small group online or classroom based tutoring sessions. </p>
